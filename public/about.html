<h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
<p>My name is Taylor Lamorie, and I am originally from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada. I graduated in May 2022 
  with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and a minor in Mathematics from Lake Superior State University 
  in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. My passion has always been learning new programming languages and techniques. I have 
  a keen interest in airplanes, and before pursuing a career in engineering, I attended flight school with the goal 
  of becoming a certified pilot. However, I discovered that I enjoyed the mathematics and engineering aspects involved 
  in airplane development even more.</p>

<p>I have a genuine interest to further develop my programming skills and knowledge and am seeking an opportunity 
  that will allow me to learn new programming languages and to challenge myself in the application of new software 
  in innovative projects, while being engaged in problem-solving and troubleshooting. I am committed to completing 
  projects with attention to both detail and quality, recognizing and appreciating the value of persevering, of 
  learning from what did not work, and of experimenting with new ideas and modifications.</p>

<p>On a personal level, I am a mature and responsible individual who works well both independently and as a team, 
  and who builds positive relationships and rapport with colleagues. I have excellent organization and time management 
  skills and understand the importance of completing tasks even when faced with competing priorities. I believe in 
  keeping both my mind and my body healthy, thus I enjoy engaging in personal fitness, golf, hockey and soccer to keep
  myself physically fit, and also seek new learning opportunities to grow, challenge and improve myself as a learner 
  and employee.</p>
